            <li>Transfer the dough to a baking sheet or pizza stone that has been lightly dusted with cornmeal.</li>
            <li>Spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edge for the crust.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Arrange the sliced pepperoni and black olives over the cheese..</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the crust is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle the chopped fresh basil over the top.</li>
            <li>Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure your oven is fully preheated before baking the pizza. A hot oven is key to achieving a crispy crust.</li>
            <li>Don't overload the pizza with too many toppings, as this can make the crust soggy. Stick to a few key toppings for the best results.</li>
            <li>Don't overcook the rice as it will become mushy and lose its texture.</li>
            <li>Experiment with different sauces and toppings to find your favorite flavor combinations. You can try pesto sauce, different types of cheese, and a variety of vegetables and meats.</li>
            <li>For a crispier crust, you can pre-bake the pizza dough for a few minutes before adding the toppings. This will help ensure the crust doesn't get too soggy.</li>
          </ul>
